# Infinity Typewriter Feature

An **open source** project that creates an infinite typewriter effect.

> ### Features:
> 
> - The code has already been made to implement more words, in the case of an array, in others, you must change the code according to your needs.
>
> - As tested, the program is infinite, it will always change the highlighted word, and it will never repeat the word more than twice.
>
> - If you want to change the highlight time, you must manually change setInterval and setTimeout. A variable was not created for this.
>
> - If the interval time to erase the old word, it must be changed manually according to the need.
